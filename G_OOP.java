	A class describes what the object will be, but is separate from the object itself.
	In other words, classes can be described as blueprints, descriptions, or definitions 
	for an object. You can use the same class as a blueprint for creating multiple objects. 
	The first step is to define the class, which then becomes a blueprint for object creation.
	In other words, an object is an instance of a class.
